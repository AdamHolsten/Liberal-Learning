Students will learn about French culture, make comparisons between this culture and their own, and establish connections with other disciplines such as history, sociology, film studies, and literature. We will study both products and practices of French culture, participating in group-activities to analyze a broad range of texts including those representative of high culture (e.g., literature and film) and low culture (e.g., television commercials or expectations of riding in the subway in Paris). Ultimately, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the social practices and expectations of French in their own native speech community and will develop and practice critical thinking skills in analyzing stereotypical ideas of France, French, and French culture. Students will demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of France as a complex society with a turbulent history and a future fraught with both potential and challenge. Students with French-language expertise may opt to take the course for LAC credit with readings and papers in French.",

The everyday sexual violation of black women by slaveholders, overseers, and others, not only tested legal definitions of sexual assault and rape, but also shaped the lives of enslaved women. Using primary source materials, biographies, monographs, and small group discussion, students will examine the challenges that enslaved black women faced in the late eighteenth century and the nineteenth century.

Philosophers have argued that the only appropriate response to the phenomenon of the Holocaust is silence. Such views cast the Holocaust in a special category of representation. Is the Holocaust so sacred that its representation should be limited? What should the limits be? Who is to say what qualifies & what does not? How will it be remembered if it cannot be represented by each new generation? Should we think about authenticity in Holocaust representations? How do we regard the Nazi-created texts documenting the Holocaust, such as the iconic photograph in the Warsaw Ghetto of the boy with his hands raised? That is, is the particular gaze of the creator of the representation important? To consider these issues, students will engage with theories of Holocaust representation by such figures as Berel Lang, Hayden White, Geoffrey Hartman, Marianne Hirsch, Janet Wolff & others. They will study a range of Holocaust representations in literature & film that test these theories. The primary texts will include familiar literary texts such as those by Anne Frank & Elie Wiesel & some by less familiar figures, such as Anne Michaels (novel: Fugitive Pieces), Art Spiegelman(graphic novel: Maus), & Michael Verhoeven (film: The Nasty Girl).

Beyond the business school, students will be invited to consider the: questioning methods of philosophy and applied ethics to deepen their search for problems to solve; observation methods from anthropology to identify opportunities and needs; methods of narrative from literary studies to create new and deeper meanings; and tools from social science to test and refine new ideas.

Students will work in teams to complete approximately 5 experiments over the course of the semester.  Some of the learning goals for the course are to become familiar with common experimental techniques, proper laboratory documentation, and error propagation and analysis.  Students will perform background reading and pre-lab assignments and design and construct each experiment.  In addition to daily writing in a laboratory notebook, students will also produce a final paper on one of their experiments; this course is therefore an upper-level writing intensive course that can serve as a capstone course.

From this overview we will see that there is ongoing discussion about both the most effective approach to the study of gender and language, and about the theoretical underpinnings which are evoked by, for example, various definitions of key concepts such as \"gender.\" Particular attention will be given in the course to approaches to language and gender that have developed within sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology and which focus on the way in which both language and gender are embedded in structures of power, authority, and social inequality, and with conflicts over these social structures.",
