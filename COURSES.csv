How have notions of the world itself changed in the last six centuries? This course offers a broad historical survey of the modern world from the late 1400s while trying to curtail Eurocentric and masculinist assumptions from the narrative of world history and the history of empires. We will begin by exploring the powerful Islamic gunpowder empires such as the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, and their struggles with European powers striving for colonial expansion. What made European colonialism and global hegemony eventually possible, and how did various local cultures respond? What role did gender and sexuality play in sustaining empires? Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British imperialists not only imposed European norms and systems on the new territories they colonized, but they also adapted to Native American, African and Asian forms of science and governance, and forged domestic ties with local women. This hierarchical cultural interaction not only changed the political, economic and knowledge structures of non-Western societies, but in the process also transformed Europe.   In this course, we will look at the crucial role played by scientific and cultural ideologies of gender, sexuality, race and religion in sustaining imperialism and colonialism. We will explore how imperialism led to the world wars and how colonized people were dragged into the wars. We will look at anti-colonial nationalist struggles that led to decolonization, as well as transnational Afro-Asian collaborations against Western imperialism and neo-colonialism.
