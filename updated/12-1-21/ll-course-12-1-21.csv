Is the Holocaust so sacred that its representation should be limited? What should the limits be? Who is to say what qualifies & what does not? How will it be remembered if it cannot be represented by each new generation? Should we think about authenticity in Holocaust representations? How do we regard the Nazi-created texts documenting the Holocaust, such as the iconic photograph in the Warsaw Ghetto of the boy with his hands raised? That is, is the particular gaze of the creator of the representation important? To consider these issues, students will engage with theories of Holocaust representation by such figures as Berel Lang, Hayden White, Geoffrey Hartman, Marianne Hirsch, Janet Wolff & others.
